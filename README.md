# Clinical Text Annotation Portfolio
### Named Entity Recognition (NER) & Relation Extraction

---

## About This Project

As a **Registered Nurse transitioning into Healthcare AI**, I completed a structured **clinical text annotation project** focused on **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** and **relation extraction** from unstructured clinical notes.

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to apply **clinical reasoning**, **medical language understanding**, and **annotation precision** to produce high-quality training data for **healthcare NLP and AI systems**.

All clinical notes were sourced from **publicly available, fully de-identified datasets** and annotated using standardized clinical NLP workflows.

**Target Roles:** Clinical Text Annotator 
**Focus Areas:** Clinical NER, modifiers, relation extraction  
**Availability:** Immediate | Remote

## 📋 Clinical Notes Annotated

| Specialty | Note Type | Entities Annotated | Relations Extracted |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Pediatrics | Bronchiolitis | 57 | 5 |
| Pediatrics | Kawasaki Disease | 88 | 9 |
| Cardiovascular | Acute STEMI | 93 | 6 |
| Cardiovascular | Aortic Stenosis | 83 | 10 |
| Emergency Medicine | Anaphylaxis | 119 | 15 |
| Emergency Medicine | Septic Shock | 110 | 10 |

**Total:** 6 clinical notes  
**Annotations:** 550 entities | 55 relations

## Entity Types Annotated

- PATIENT_DEMOGRAPHICS
- DIAGNOSIS
- SYMPTOM
- SIGN
- VITAL_SIGN
- DIAGNOSTIC_TEST
- TEST_RESULT
- LAB_VALUE
- MEDICATION
- DOSAGE
- ROUTE
- RATE
- FREQUENCY
- PROCEDURE
- ANATOMY
- EXPOSURE
- TEMPORAL
- PROCEDURE_RESULT


Entities were labeled using **standardized medical terminology** with contextual interpretation.

---

## 🔗 Relation Types Extracted

- DIAGNOSIS: "shows," "reveals," "consistent with," "confirms," "by criteria"
- TREATS: "for," "to treat," "given for," "administered for"
- CAUSES: "due to," "caused by," "secondary to," "post-procedure developed"
- INDICATION: "for," "requiring," "to evaluate," "indicated for"
  
The "Lawyer Test"
If you can't quote specific words justifying the relation, don't annotate it.
Relations were annotated only when **clinically meaningful and text-supported**.

---

## Clinical Modifiers Applied

Each relevant entity was enriched with structured clinical modifiers:

### Severity
Applies to: Diagnoses, symptoms, signs, test results
Values: Mild, Moderate, Severe, Critical

### Clinical Course
Applies to: Diagnoses, symptoms, signs
Values: Improving, Worsening, Stable, Progressive, Resolved, Persistent

### Disease Status
Applies to: Diagnoses ONLY
Values: Acute, Chronic, Active, Inactive, Resolved, Recurrent, Remote, Sudden onset, Gradual onset, Intermittent

### Negation
Applies to: Absent entities
Values: Present (entity EXISTS), Absent (entity DOES NOT exist)

## Tools & Methodology

- **Annotation Platform:** Label Studio  
- **Annotation Schema:** Custom ontology informed by **UMLS / SNOMED CT**  
- **Guideline Reference:** i2b2 Clinical NLP standards  
- **Quality Assurance:** Systematic self-review and consistency checks  

Annotations followed a **reproducible and documented workflow**.
