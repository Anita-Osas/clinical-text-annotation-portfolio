  # Annotation Count Methodology

 ### Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Each annotated span in the Label Studio JSON export was counted as one entity.
- Negation was captured as a modifier associated with entities
- Repeated mentions were counted separately
- Entity counts were obtained by reviewing the JSON export from Label Studio


 ### Relation Annotations (RA)
Each explicit relation arrow between two entities was counted as one relation.
- Only relations supported by explicit text were annotated
- No relations were inferred based on clinical knowledge alone


 ### Notes
- The dataset contains six annotated clinical notes within a single Label Studio project export.
- The dataset consists of manually annotated clinical notes exported from Label Studio in JSON format.
- The dataset contains six annotated clinical notes with an average of 92 entities and 9 relations per note.
- Entities represent individual textual mentions of clinical concepts and include repeated mentions when concepts appear multiple times.


**Clinical modifiers such as negation, severity, disease status, and clinical course were annotated separately as attributes and were not counted as entities.**
